# Machine Learning Final Project

## Reproducing my submission

### Environment Setup & Installation

Python version : 3.9.7

All the packages that should be installed are in requirements.txt

First download requirements.txt

Build the virtual environment via   
$ virtualenv -p <path to python version> myenv
